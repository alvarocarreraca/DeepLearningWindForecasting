Wind energy has experienced a huge development over the
last decade due to its importance in decarbonising the worldâ€™s
economy and making a green energy transition. The main
goal of this paper is to implement and test deep learning algo-
rithms that could perform a proper forecast of the power gen-
erated by one park, Park Power, with 48-hours in advance.
The data is provided by a Chinese company that recorded in-
formation every 15 minutes during almost 4 years. Based on
the nature of the data used and the time-dependant patterns
that govern the power curves, it was considered Convolu-
tional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) as the deep learning algorithms used for forecasting.
Thus, searching for a generalized model for each of the al-
gorithms and comparing the performance of both algorithms
will be the aim of this report, concluding that the CNN out-
performs LSTM forecasting reaching to 93.857% of accuracy
rate. Also, an individualized temporal analysis will be done
for each of the algorithms, this concludes that the bigger the
time window for LSTM predication, the better performs.
